    double salaryGrowToDouble() {

      }

It looks like you're trying to define a method that doubles a salary and prints the result. However, there are several issues with your code. Here are the corrected code and explanations of the problems:

Incorrect Method Definition and Return Type: The method salaryGrowToDouble should return a double value, but currently, it doesn't return anything.
Class Definition Inside Method: Defining a class inside a method like this isn't appropriate for the task. A simple method will suffice.
Syntax Errors: The class growSum and its method definitions are incorrect.
Accessing Local Variables: The way you're trying to access and print the new salary is incorrect.
Here's the corrected version of your code:

java
Copy code
public class SalaryCalculator {

    public double salaryGrowToDouble(double salary) {
        double newSalary = salary * 2;
        System.out.println("New salary is: " + newSalary);
        return newSalary;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SalaryCalculator calculator = new SalaryCalculator();
        double currentSalary = 50000;  // Example salary
        double doubledSalary = calculator.salaryGrowToDouble(currentSalary);
    }
}
Explanation:
Method Definition and Return Type:

The salaryGrowToDouble method now takes a double parameter (salary) and returns a double.
Inside the method, the new salary is calculated by doubling the input salary (salary * 2).
Printing the Result:

The new salary is printed inside the method using System.out.println.
Returning the New Salary:

The method returns the new doubled salary.
Main Method to Test:

A main method is added to create an instance of SalaryCalculator, and an example salary is passed to the salaryGrowToDouble method.
Running the Code:
When you run this code, it will print the new salary and return it. For example, if the input salary is 50000, the output will be:

vbnet
Copy code
New salary is: 100000.0
This should address the issues you were facing. If you encounter any specific error messages or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define salaryGrowToDouble as a method inside the Employee class, not as an inner class.
Ensure the id increments properly for each instance.
Call the salaryGrowToDouble method correctly.
Here is the corrected code:

java
Copy code
package Homework.Homework5;

public class Employee {
    static int idCounter = 1;
    int id;
    String surname;
    String name;
    int age;
    double salary;
    String department;

    // Constructor to initialize an Employee and increment the id
    public Employee(String surname, String name, int age, double salary, String department) {
        this.id = idCounter++;
        this.surname = surname;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.department = department;
    }

    // Method to double the salary
    public void salaryGrowToDouble() {
        this.salary = this.salary * 2;
        System.out.println("New doubled salary is: " + this.salary);
    }

    // Method to show employee information
    void showInfoEmployee() {
        System.out.println("Employee ID number: " + this.id);
        System.out.println("Employee name: " + this.name);
        System.out.println("Employee surname: " + this.surname);
        System.out.println("Employee age: " + this.age);
        System.out.println("Employee salary: " + this.salary);
        System.out.println("Employee department: " + this.department);
    }
}

class EmployeeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an Employee instance
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Jdanov", "Ilya", 28, 25000, "Marketing department");

        // Show initial employee information
        e1.showInfoEmployee();

        // Double the salary
        e1.salaryGrowToDouble();

        // Show updated employee information
        e1.showInfoEmployee();
    }
}
Explanation:
Employee Constructor:

Initializes the employee fields and increments the id for each new instance using idCounter.
salaryGrowToDouble Method:

This method doubles the current salary and prints the new doubled salary.
showInfoEmployee Method:

Displays the employee's information.
EmployeeTest Class:

Creates an Employee instance with the specified details.
Displays the initial information, doubles the salary, and then displays the updated information.
This should work correctly and provide the desired functionality. Run this code to see the output, and you should see the initial and updated employee information with the doubled salary. If you encounter any more issues, please let me know!
